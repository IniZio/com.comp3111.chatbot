Emphasis will be placed on the “practical exercise” for the simulation of future climate in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases using the web-based global climate model (EdGCM) with a user-friendly interface that can be run on laptop or desktop computer. Through this practice, students will learn full scientific processes related to climate modeling such as experimental design, running simulation, data analysis, and interpretation of results. On this foundation, the latter half of the course will be shifted to the topics for the identification and assessment of the risks from climate extremes. Eventually, students will have familiarity with climate modeling techniques and better sense to grapple with a myriad of complex climate issues."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"1708","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2017-09-05T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-28T16:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2404, Lift 17-18 (81)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2017-09-07T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-30T16:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 2404, Lift 17-18 (81)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["IM, Eun Soon"],"quota":{"total":"40","hold":{},"public":40},"enrol":"12","avail":"28","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},"CIVL4320":{"id":"CIVL4320","department":"CIVL","code":"4320","name":"Structural Steel Design","credit":"3","details":{"pre-requisite":[{"course":"CIVL3310"}],"description":"Limit state design of steel structures, stability analysis of thin-walled members, design of tension members, columns, beams, plate girders, beam-columns, structural connections, plastic analysis and design."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"1709","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2017-09-06T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-29T14:50:00+08:00","location":"G012, LSK Bldg (200)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"2017-09-01T13:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-24T14:50:00+08:00","location":"G012, LSK Bldg (200)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Chun Man"],"quota":{"total":"140","hold":{"CIVL":{"quota":"137","enrol":"103","avail":"34"}},"public":3},"enrol":"106","avail":"34","wait":"27","remarks":{}},{"name":"T1","class_number":"1711","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2017-09-06T10:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-29T11:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 5620, Lift 31-32 (70)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Chun Man"],"quota":{"total":"70","hold":{},"public":70},"enrol":"70","avail":"0","wait":"30","remarks":{}},{"name":"T2","class_number":"1713","classes":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2017-09-07T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-30T16:50:00+08:00","location":"Rm 5620, Lift 31-32 (70)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["CHAN, Chun Man"],"quota":{"total":"70","hold":{},"public":70},"enrol":"36","avail":"34","wait":"2","remarks":{}}]},"CIVL4380":{"id":"CIVL4380","department":"CIVL","code":"4380","name":"Introduction to Wind Effects on Buildings and Structures","credit":"3","details":{"exclusion":[{"course":"CIVL5370"}],"description":"Basic meteorology, structure of wind near the ground, wind induced vibrations, wind loading codes, wind tunnel test techniques."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"3849","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2017-09-05T09:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-28T10:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 5506, Lift 25-26 (30)","note":"N/A"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2017-09-07T09:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-30T10:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 5506, Lift 25-26 (30)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["LAM, Kit Ming","TSE, Kam Tim"],"quota":{"total":"30","hold":{},"public":30},"enrol":"30","avail":"0","wait":"1","remarks":{}},{"name":"T1","class_number":"3850","classes":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"2017-09-06T16:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-29T17:20:00+08:00","location":"G002, CYT Bldg (30)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["LAM, Kit Ming","TSE, Kam Tim"],"quota":{"total":"30","hold":{},"public":30},"enrol":"30","avail":"0","wait":"1","remarks":{}}]},"CIVL4440":{"id":"CIVL4440","department":"CIVL","code":"4440","name":"Environmental Systems Analysis","credit":"3","details":{"pre-requisite":[{"course":"CIVL2410"}],"previous code":[{"course":"CIVL4100B"}],"description":"This course introduces principles of systems analysis for the planning and management of the environment.

For both Aristotle and Mencius, the logic of arguments and the art of rhetoric are the chief weapons in the service of truth.

With constant expansion of aerospace industry driven by economic development, universities are required to better equip the students with knowledge and skills in design. The essence of design activities is to apply a variety of methods in an integrated manner, in order to produce design solutions which meet a set of objectives and constraints from technical, commercial, and social perspectives. This also need to be achieved in a schedule demanded by the customer, and within the specified budget, in order to maintain competitiveness against products from competitors. In this course, a set of advanced topics will be provided which complement what students would typically learn during studies at the undergraduate level. Students will be exposed to (1) principles, workflows and methods in multidisciplinary aircraft design practice, (2) concepts of some advanced engineering optimization methods and strategies, (3) some case studies used in industry design office or joint university-industry effort in research activities. At the end of the course, students will be able to formulate a conceptual aircraft optimization problem, build a variety of simulation models of various fidelity, and apply multi-objective optimization methods to solving the complex simulation-based design optimization problems."},"sections":[{"name":"L1","class_number":"3377","classes":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"2017-09-07T15:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-30T17:50:00+08:00","location":"G003, CYT Bldg (30)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["SONG, Wenbin"],"quota":{"total":"30","hold":{},"public":30},"enrol":"13","avail":"17","wait":"0","remarks":{}},{"name":"T1","class_number":"3378","classes":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"2017-09-05T10:30:00+08:00","end_time":"2017-11-28T11:20:00+08:00","location":"Rm 5560, Lift 27-28 (30)","note":"N/A"}],"instructors":["SONG, Wenbin"],"quota":{"total":"30","hold":{},"public":30},"enrol":"13","avail":"17","wait":"0","remarks":{}}]},"MECH4000I":{"id":"MECH4000I","department":"MECH","code":"4000I","name":"Introduction to Nanosatellite Engineering","credit":"Experiential Course)","details":{"pre-requisite":[{"course":"MECH3610"}],"description":"This course will introduce the fundamental concepts of CubeSat – a class of nanosatellite with standardized unit size of 10x10x10 cm.
